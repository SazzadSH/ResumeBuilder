=====================================

## To Submit this Assignment
- fork this repository
- write all of your code in a directory named `lab-#`; + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab08-amanda`
- push to your repository
- submit a pull request to this repository
- submit a link to your PR in canvas

## Directions 
- Create a new Console Application within Visual Studio 2017.
- Create a program that uses the Factory Method Design Pattern 
- This program should consist of a document/resume creation factory.
- You are creating types of **Documents** that make up a **Resume** or **Report**, that conists of different **Pages** such as **Cover Letter**, **References**, **Work History**, **Summary Page** etc...
- Identify the following. **In your readme** (hint: i bolded some of the important keywords)
    1. Product --
    2. Concrete Product --
    3. Creator --
    4. Concrete Creator --
- In your Program.cs file should clearly show through Console.WriteLines() that your program is functioning as requried.   

## ReadMe
A README is a module consumer's first -- and maybe only -- look into your creation. The consumer wants a module to fulfill their need, so you must explain exactly what need your module fills, and how effectively it does so.
<br />
Your job is to

1. tell them what it is (with context)
2. show them what it looks like in action
3. show them how they use it
4. tell them any other relevant details
<br />

This is ***your*** job. It's up to the module creator to prove that their work is a shining gem in the sea of slipshod modules. Since so many developers' eyes will find their way to your README before anything else, quality here is your public-facing measure of your work.

<br /> <br /> Refer to the sample-README in the class repo for an example.

## Rubric
- 7pts: Program meets all requirements described in Lab directions
- 3pts: Code meets industry standards

- **Readme.md required for submission. Missing readme document and tests will result in a best score of 2/10**

## Stretch
1. Gain 3pts bonus for **each** Design Pattern you succesfully implement in a new problem domain. 
2. Your Code has to be clearly commented. Make it clear that you are comfortable with the design pattern of choice. 
2. Need ideas? Let me know, we can brainstorm Problem Domains for other design patterns.
